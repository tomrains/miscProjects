Refactoring the vanishing chess game

Bonus:

- if refresh used, alert user that the game will be reset if they go through with it.
- add functionality that shows the available spaces a selected piece can move to (we've have to use POSITIVE coding here... much easier ... now we are assuming true and then ruling out ones that dont fit)
- have different classes for selected pieces based on how well you're doing. if you're well ahead, they look gold and shiny... ...if oyu're behind, they look puke green and tired
- add a special class that shows when a king has been checkmated/defeated. maybe even the attacking piece can do something cool.
- simple AI so you don't have to move for other team (they can be idiots though if necessary)
- allow yourself to deselect a piece if you click it a second time
- add switch cases to appropriate lines of code
- consider changing el's in the code to somthing more descriptive
- find answer to this question: why are some of the getElementsByClassName objects so buggy, like filled with undefineds?
- read through code and address all my notes
- allow ability to see if you're in check AND the piece is selected. should overrule the other ones
- add AI
- add stalemate functionality
